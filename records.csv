One such resident is 69-year-old Adele Steen, who took to the skies in a helicopter over Weston-super-Mare. Adele, who has used a wheelchair all her life after contracting polio at an early age, has always been fascinated with the sky, so the team made her dream of flying become a reality. Staff, residents and family watched as Adele was flown over Beach Lawns in her own chartered flight from The Helicopter Museum. Another resident told home manager Lyn that he was determined to climb Mount Kilimanjaro for Comic Relief. Unfortunately, due to his mobility, this was not possible but he came up with an even better idea that could get everyone involved. With the support of the team, he organised a sponsored walk around the home, gardens and adjoining park with fellow residents and staff members, raising &pound;500 for charity.

With this in mind, there is the old fashioned cottage kitchen, with a traditional Range oven, a wooden table and vintage-style kitchen equipment. Residents will sit together and supported by the team will prep vegetables for dinner, make cakes and cookies, fold tea towels and simply do things that are meaningful to them.

Popular visitors are toddlers from our local nursery, who come along every week to join in with activities. The benefits of these visits for both our residents and the children are heart-warming to see. Residents have been known to form close bonds with the toddlers.

Our residents also love their daily visits from our dogs. Bella the Labradoodle and Arlo the Shih Tzu, who is so tiny he sits on our residents&rsquo; laps!

Where you&rsquo;ll work
At Pinewood Residential Care Home, our activities leader Lorraine Erich was proud to be shortlisted for the London regional finals of the Great British Care Awards 2018, for the Care Home Activity Organiser Award. The award is for someone who shows &lsquo;exceptional skills and creativity&rsquo; when it comes to providing activities. Lorraine, who has worked at the care home for 27 years, has inspired the rest of the team to value the importance of activities when it comes to fulfilling the lives of their residents and making sure they are happy and engaged. Part of the nomination for her award read: &ldquo;One resident would not spend time with any other residents and nobody could persuade her otherwise. She loved to knit but said she couldn&rsquo;t do it because of her arthritis. Lorraine got her some wider needles and persuaded her to try &ndash; she has been knitting ever since! Lorraine then set up Pinewood&rsquo;s knitting circle, which this lady helps run.&rdquo;

The care home could not be in a more picture-perfect location in North Ayrshire, 100m from the beautiful beach, with views across the sea. The team spends a lot of time taking the residents to places across the island, with plenty of picnics on the beach. There is a nearby community garden in the grounds of the garrison, where the home has raised beds which the residents take great pride in maintaining. There is also a gym and coffee shops. With two minibuses at Millport, the residents are never short of places to visit and things to do. The loved ones of our residents are very much part of our care home. Most of them have sons and daughters living with us, so we go above and beyond to enable them to enjoy quality family time together. This can mean taking our residents to visit their parents if they too live in a residential care home themselves. We often invite elderly parents to visit Millport with friends from their own care homes, making their visits extra special.

Where you&rsquo;ll work
The care home could not be in a more picture-perfect location in North Ayrshire, 100m from the beautiful beach, with views across the sea. The team spends a lot of time taking the residents to places across the island, with plenty of picnics on the beach. There is a nearby community garden in the grounds of the garrison, where the home has raised beds which the residents take great pride in maintaining. There is also a gym and coffee shops. With two minibuses at Millport, the residents are never short of places to visit and things to do. The loved ones of our residents are very much part of our care home. Most of them have sons and daughters living with us, so we go above and beyond to enable them to enjoy quality family time together. This can mean taking our residents to visit their parents if they too live in a residential care home themselves. We often invite elderly parents to visit Millport with friends from their own care homes, making their visits extra special.

Where you&rsquo;ll work
We very much embrace our Scottish heritage, with accordion players, highland dancers and traditional storytellers among the many talents from the East Lothian area that come to the home. Traditional Scottish fare is at the heart of our regional menu, with classics including neeps and tatties, Scotch pie and haggis and stovies. For our residents who live with dementia, our nursing home has a very special addition to their technology, the &lsquo;Magic Table&rsquo;, which is a piece of sensory equipment created in the Netherlands. It uses light games projected onto a table to encourage residents to engage with each other. It&rsquo;s a real joy to see residents, particularly those who may find verbal communication difficult, responding to the magical lights and sounds of the games.

You are likely to find us making the most of our care home technology, having invested in a new &lsquo;experience table&rsquo;. With interactive light games designed especially for people living in the mid-to-late-stages of dementia, it brings people together in a calming but stimulating environment. There are a number of games, which feature projected images of flowers, balls and even goldfish! Residents reach out to touch the images, which respond to their physical movements. Four-legged friends, including dogs, ponies and rabbits, often visit for animal therapy sessions. As you can imagine these activities are very popular and help to bring back happy memories for residents who once had their own pets. They are also extremely beneficial for our residents receiving nursing care, as they can provide one-to-one interaction, often in the comfort of their own bedroom.

Residents will sit together and supported by the team will prep vegetables for dinner, make cakes and cookies, fold tea towels and simply do things that are meaningful to them. There is a bar area called The Dog and Trumpet, which has a working gramophone and old records to play. There is a traditional bar, tables and chairs.

Starting their lives in an incubator from Hatching Eggs in Stoke-on-Trent, these pets are a really important part of our home and we&rsquo;ve grown to really love them. Our residents also enjoy spending their time sowing seeds in the raised beds and hanging baskets. Not only that, they look after the fruit and veg patch. We are currently growing lettuces to feed to the chickens, who are by far the most pampered care home pets in Newcastle-under-Lyme!

With cosy lounges dotted throughout the home, rather than one big communal space, Westmead feels like a real family home. They are perfect places to catch up when someone special visits or enjoy group activities such as visits from Pets As Therapy (PAT) dogs. One of our lounges has also been blessed and acts as the spiritual room for our residents who are religious, with services from the local Droitwich churches taking place here.

Activities are without a doubt a very important part of life in the home. With a team of three activities staff and a range of skills, the variety of the activities in the home is as diverse. We love to tailor activities to our residents. We recently invited a jazz band to perform and a resident joined in for a jamming session. Another of our ladies, who lives with dementia, recently wrote a list of things she would love to do before she hits 100. One of these was to spend time in a police car. So, with the help of a kind local officer from West Mercia Police, armed with handcuffs, she managed to tick one of these things off her list! In addition to this, we have a resident who once made hats for The Queen, as well as another who gives sugarcraft lessons to our team.

Where you&rsquo;ll work
You are likely to find us making the most of our care home technology, having invested in a new &lsquo;experience table&rsquo;. With interactive light games designed especially for people living in the mid-to-late-stages of dementia, it brings people together in a calming but stimulating environment. There are a number of games, which feature projected images of flowers, balls and even goldfish! Residents reach out to touch the images, which respond to their physical movements. Four-legged friends, including dogs, ponies and rabbits, often visit for animal therapy sessions.

Where you&rsquo;ll work
Activities are without a doubt a very important part of life in the home. With a team of three activities staff and a range of skills, the variety of the activities in the home is as diverse. We love to tailor activities to our residents. We recently invited a jazz band to perform and a resident joined in for a jamming session. Another of our ladies, who lives with dementia, recently wrote a list of things she would love to do before she hits 100. One of these was to spend time in a police car. So, with the help of a kind local officer from West Mercia Police, armed with handcuffs, she managed to tick one of these things off her list! In addition to this, we have a resident who once made hats for The Queen, as well as another who gives sugarcraft lessons to our team.

Gardening activities are a wonderful form of therapy, reigniting the passion for a pastime that many of our residents loved to do before moving into residential care. The fresh air and smell of aromatic herbs also stimulate the senses. With mint, thyme and basil, you can often find us picking herbs. This brings back fond memories for our residents who loved to get creative in their own kitchens. While we are outside we can&rsquo;t forget to mention our barbecue garden, with a relaxed seating area. This is a really popular spot in the warmer months for family gatherings and community events.

Where you&rsquo;ll work
When you walk into the care home, it&rsquo;s like you are taking a step back in time. The environment is designed to feel homely and stimulate reminiscence. For many residents the kitchen would have been the heart of their home. Families would sit around chatting and preparing food together. With this in mind, there is the old fashioned cottage kitchen, with a traditional Range oven, a wooden table and vintage-style kitchen equipment. Residents will sit together and supported by the team will prep vegetables for dinner, make cakes and cookies, fold tea towels and simply do things that are meaningful to them. There is a bar area called The Dog and Trumpet, which has a working gramophone and old records to play. There is a traditional bar, tables and chairs. This is a lovely area for residents to take loved ones when they visit. They can sit together and have lunch, with a tipple of something that takes their fancy.

Where you&rsquo;ll work
In the borough of Welwyn &amp;Hatfield, our residential and nursing home is situated in a community filled with a rich heritage. In the 1930s the De Havilland Aircraft Company opened a factory, where the first every Comet Racer was designed and manufactured. Some of our residents even worked at the Hertfordshire factory, and now the home proudly sits where that very factory once stood. To mark our community&rsquo;s legacy, we have named our very own pub &lsquo;The Comet&rsquo;, which is wonderful for reminiscence. Complete with pumps and optics and vintage aviation d&eacute;cor, including traditional pictures of bi-planes and the Comet Racer itself. As you can imagine, The Comet is a popular spot in the care home. It ignites wonderful memories and a passion for the history of Hatfield that we are so proud of. The Comet is also a social hub right in the heart of the home. It&rsquo;s the perfect place to challenge a loved one or friend to a game of cards or catch up over dominoes.

With dimmed lights, tranquil music and aromatic scents which fill the room, our residents love to relax here. They can enjoy a hand massage or manicure, or even a wet shave for our gents. Another popular place in our care home is the courtyard garden. Every care suite in Orchard House overlooks this glorious space, which sits directly in the centre of the home. While our residential dementia care suite has direct access to a secluded garden area, with raised flower beds. Our green-fingered residents enjoy looking after the plants here, with the height of the beds meaning they can continue to enjoy a favourite pastime.

The new cinema room has been a huge hit with our residents, who as well as watching the old classics, are very fond of more modern films like Mama Mia. When this is on verses of Abba songs can be heard through Birchwood Court. There is also a popcorn machine with old fashioned cardboard cartons. Our residents are presented with cinema tickets showing the day&rsquo;s movie. They hand these in as they enter, as they would have done at their local cinema before moving into residential care. Again it is a lovely way to go back to the good old days, especially for our residents living with dementia. The new games room at Birchwood Court is a real social hub, with games machines, a pool table, jukebox, board and card games and even giant skittles.

Respecting our residents as individuals is an essential part of life at The Beeches. One resident who is originally from the Caribbean was keen to see some traditional cuisine, which was an important part of their culture on the menu. Now the chef makes everything from goat curry to a spiced sweet bun served with cheese. This dish very quickly became a firm favourite with other residents across the home. Also very popular are dishes with yam and sweet potatoes. Residents at The Beeches are very much involved in the menus. They review them on a monthly basis and the chef will make changes to reflect their preferences, ensuring alternative dishes are equal in nutritional value. Sometimes the residents love to have fish and chips from a shop in Northfield, Birmingham. They like to eat it out of paper the way it should be, so our staff take time to individually wrap every single portion!
