With a team of three activities staff and a range of skills, the variety of the activities in the home is as diverse. We love to tailor activities to our residents. We recently invited a jazz band to perform and a resident joined in for a jamming session. Another of our ladies, who lives with dementia, recently wrote a list of things she would love to do before she hits 100. One of these was to spend time in a police car. So, with the help of a kind local officer from West Mercia Police, armed with handcuffs, she managed to tick one of these things off her list! In addition to this, we have a resident who once made hats for The Queen, as well as another who gives sugarcraft lessons to our team.   Click here for further information about the home.    What skills do I need?   Experience is not essential, as we will help you with all the training and support you&rsquo;ll need to do the job, what is important is that you are caring, enthusiastic and have energy to share.

As well as the gardening club, our team supports residents to enjoy walks around the beautiful grounds. And for something a little further afield, the minibus trips and excursions to places across York and beyond are a real highlight. The weekly trips include jaunts to the seaside at Scarborough for fish and chips, the marina at Naburn or even shopping trips to York&rsquo;s designer outlet. Passionate about helping residents to remain connected to the wider community, we support them to attend a range of events outside the residential and nursing home. With both a dementia coffee morning and Kurling Club twice a month at Portholme Church and monthly Memories Caf&eacute; at the local church, our residents love to meet new people.
